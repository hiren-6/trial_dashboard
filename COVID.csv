The magnitude and duration of protection from reinfection conferred by the infection may be weaker after an asymptomatic infection as it is after a symptomatic COVID-19 episode. Moreover, it is known that immunity decreases among older adults compared to younger individuals often referred to as ''immune senescence,'' and leading to a decreased efficacy of vaccination.

This study raises the question of whether a single administration of BNT162b2 in participants with prior SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to sufficient and durable immune response.

This study includes two cohorts. Cohort 1 will include approximately 880 individuals (50 subjects/group; Groups 1E-11E) greater than 18 years of age and older, stratified into two age strata (18-55 years and \>/=56 years) who previously received COVID-19 vaccine at Emergency Use Authorization dosing (EUA) (two vaccinations of mRNA-1273 at the 100 mcg dose, two vaccinations of BNT162b2 at the 30 mcg dose, or one vaccination of Ad26.COV2.S at the 5x10\^10 vp dose). Groups 15E-17E will enroll 60 subjects, split (approximately evenly) between age strata as able. Those subjects will be offered enrollment into this study \>/=12 weeks after they received the last dose of their EUA vaccine. Subjects will receive a single open-label intramuscular (IM) injection of the designated delayed booster vaccine and will be followed through 12 months after vaccination: 1) Group 1E - previously EUA-dosed vaccination with Janssen - Ad26.COV.2.S at 5x10\^10 vp followed by a 100-mcg dose of mRNA-1273, Group 4E - previously EUA-dosed vaccination with Janssen - Ad26.COV.2.S at 5x10\^10 vp followed by a 5x10\^10 vp dose of Ad26.COV2.S, Group 7E - previously EUA-dosed vaccination with Janssen - Ad26.COV.2.S 5x10\^10 vp followed by a 30-mcg dose of BNT162b2, Group 10E - previously EUA-dosed vaccination with Janssen - Ad26.COV2-S 5x10\^10 vp followed by a 100-mcg dose of mRNA-1273.211; Group 12E - previously EUA-dosed vaccination with Janssen - Ad26.COV2-S 5x10\^10 vp followed by a 50-mcg dose of mRNA-1273; Group 15E - previously EUA-dosed vaccination with Janssen (two doses for Group 15E) - Ad26.COV2.S at 5x1010 vp followed by a dose of NVX-CoV2373 (5 mcg Prototype SARS-CoV-2 rS vaccine with 50 mcg Matrix-M); 2) Group 2E - previously EUA-dosed vaccination with Moderna - mRNA-1273 at 100 mcg for two doses followed by a 100-mcg dose of mRNA-1273, Group 5E - previously EUA-dosed vaccination with Moderna - mRNA-1273 at 100 mcg for two doses followed by a 5x10\^10 vp dose of Ad26.COV2.S, Group 8E - previously EUA-dosed vaccination with Moderna - mRNA-1273 at 100 mcg for two doses followed by a 30-mcg dose of BNT162b2, Group 13E - previously EUA-dosed vaccination with Moderna - mRNA-1273 at 100 mcg for two doses followed by a 50-mcg dose of mRNA-1273; Group 16E - previously EUA-dosed vaccination with Moderna - mRNA-1273 at 100 mcg for two doses followed by a dose of NVX-CoV2373 (5 mcg Prototype SARS-CoV2 rS vaccine with 50 mcg Matrix-M); 3) Group 3E - previously EUA-dosed vaccination with Pfizer/BioNTech - BNT162b2 at 30 mcg for two doses followed by a 100-mcg dose of mRNA-1273. Group 6E - previously EUA-dosed vaccination with Pfizer/BioNTech - BNT162b2 at 30 mcg for two doses followed by a 5x10\^10 vp dose of Ad26.COV2.S, Group 9E - previously EUA-dosed vaccination with Pfizer/BioNTech - BNT162b2 at 30 mcg for two doses followed by a 30-mcg dose of BNT162b2, Group 11E - previously EUA-dosed vaccination with Pfizer/BioNTech - BNT162b2 at 30 mcg for two doses followed by a 100-mcg dose of mRNA-1273.211. Group 14E - previously EUA-dosed vaccination with Pfizer/BioNTech - BNT162b2 at 30 mcg for two doses followed by a 50-mcg dose of mRNA-1273, Group 17E - previously EUA-dosed vaccination with Pfizer/BioNTech - BNT162b2 at 30 mcg for two doses followed by a dose of NVX-CoV2373 (5 mcg Prototype SARS-CoV2 rS vaccine with 50 mcg Matrix-M).

A telephone visit will occur one week after each primary EUA vaccination and one week after the booster dose. In person follow-up visits will occur on 14 days following completion of EUA vaccinations and on days 14, and 28 days after the booster dose, as well as 3, 6, and 12 months post the booster vaccination. Additional pools of subjects can be included if needed as additional COVID-19 vaccines are awarded EUA.

The primary objectives of this study are 1) to evaluate the safety and reactogenicity of delayed heterologous or homologous vaccine doses after EUA dosed vaccines, and 2) to evaluate the breadth of the humoral immune responses of heterologous and homologous delayed boost regimens following EUA dosing.",YES,SARS-CoV-2 Prevention,"Ad26.COV2.S, BNT162b2, mRNA-1273, mRNA-1273.211, mRNA-1273.222, SARS-CoV-2 rS/M1","Geometric Mean of Area Under the Curve (AUC) of Antibody Against WA-1 S2-P for Cohort 1, Geometric Mean AUC of Antibody Against WA-1 S2-P using 10-plex ECLIA Assay.

The non-inferiority hypothesis is used for the evaluation of the exploratory objective. The ratio of Geometric mean titers (GMTs) of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody in participants on Day 21 post-vaccination of Ad5-nCoV (previously received a 1st dose of Sputnik V) (Group A) and two doses of Sputnik V (Group B) is used for the evaluation of this hypothesis.

It is assumed to enroll about 100 subjects for each group. Additionally, 45 participants will be selected from Group A (to enter the immunogenicity subgroup for cellular immune response analysis. According to the above, considering extra subjects for compensating about 10% dropouts, the sample size of Group A is designed to be 450, for Group B is 200. Participants enrolled in Group A (1st dose of Sputnik V plus 1 dose of Ad5-nCoV) must have only received the 1st dose of Sputnik V and the interval between the previous injection (1st dose of Sputnik V) and the day of vaccination with Ad5-nCoV should be between 21 and 90 days.

The first of the experimental vaccines is called DoCo-Pro-RBD-1 + M59® and contains a laboratory made protein which looks the same as a protein in the SARS-CoV-2 virus. As this protein is so similar to a protein in the SARS-CoV-2 virus, it allows the immune system to develop immunity against the real virus by producing specific antibodies against this protein. Antibodies are substances in the blood which could help protect against future infection. The second of the experimental vaccines that will be tested is called MIPSCo-mRNA-RBD-1. This type of vaccine uses messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) which is a set of instructions for a cell to make a viral protein called an antigen. Antigens are substances that can trigger the body's defences to produce antibodies that fight against the disease.

This study will test these two experimental COVID-19 vaccines in people who have previously received two doses of ComirnatyTM (Pfizer Australia Pty Ltd) or VaxzevriaTM (AstraZeneca Pty Ltd) and a third booster vaccination with either ComirnatyTM or SpikevaxTM (Moderna). This study is the first time this recombinant protein vaccine and this mRNA vaccine will be given to humans. The purpose of this study is to determine what amount, or dose, of the experimental vaccines is safe and produces the desired immune response and antibody level for future investigations.

This study consists of four parts:

Part 1 (Phase 1) will evaluate the safety of the study vaccines in 100 healthy individuals.

Part 2 (Phase 2) will evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of the study vaccines in 300 healthy individuals.

Part 3 (Phase 3a) will evaluate the safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy of the study vaccines in 600 individuals with and without underlying medical conditions.

Part 4 (Phase 3b) will evaluate the safety and efficacy of the study vaccines in 16,000 individuals with and without underlying medical conditions.

Part 5 (Phase 3c) will evaluate the safety and non-inferiority in immunogenicity of ARCT-154 vaccine vs. Astra Zeneca COVID-19 vaccine (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19) in 2400 individuals with and without underlying medical conditions.

In Phase 1, healthy individuals 18 to \< 60 years of age will be enrolled. In Phase 2, 3a, and 3b, individuals 18 years of age and older will be enrolled including individuals with underlying medical conditions that put them at higher risk of complications of COVID-19 disease.

Phase 1, Phase 2, Phase 3a and Phase 3b participants will be randomly assigned to a study group that will receive up to 2 vaccination series. Each vaccination series comprises two vaccinations at 28-day intervals: an initial vaccination series with vaccinations on Day 1 and Day 29 and an additional vaccination series around 2 months after the first series (on Day 92 and 120).
